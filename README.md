Jesse is an advanced crypto trading framework that aims to **simplify** **researching** and defining **YOUR OWN trading strategies**.

## Why Jesse?
In short, Jesse is more **accurate** than other solutions, and way more **simple**. 
In fact, it is so simple that in case you already know Python, you can get started today, in **matter of minutes**, instead of **weeks and months**. 

**[Here](https://docs.jesse.trade/docs/)** you can read more about Jesse's features and why you should use it. 

## Getting Started
Head over to the "getting started" section of the [documentation](https://docs.jesse.trade/docs/getting-started). The 
documentation is **short yet very informative**.

## How to contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the project. The best way to contribute is by **participating in the community** and **helping other users**. 

You can also contribute by submitting **bug reports** and **feature requests** or writing code (submitting PRs) which can be incorporated into Jesse itself.

In that case, here's what you need to know:

- Before starting to work on a PR, please **reach out** to make sure it **aligns** with the **project's roadmap** and **vision**.
- If your PR makes changes to the source code, please make sure to **add unit tests**. If you're not sure how to do that, just check out some of the already existing [tests](https://github.com/jesse-ai/jesse/tree/master/tests).

First, you need to install Jesse from the repository instead of PyPi:


Now every change you make to the code will be affected immediately.

After every change, **make sure** your changes did not **break** any functionality by **running tests**:
```
pytest
```
